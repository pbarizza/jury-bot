","The financial system, both globally and regionally, has historically sidelined women—resulting in a persistent gender gap in wealth creation, investment participation, and access to financial services. While financial literacy is on the rise, the available platforms often lack cultural context, trust, or actionable guidance. Many women are either overwhelmed by the complexity of financial tools or excluded from networks where financial knowledge and deal flow are shared.

From investing fundamentals to advanced financial planning, we deliver engaging masterclasses, live bootcamps, and digital workshops led by regional and global experts.   Limited Access to Investment Tools and Deal Flow: Most women are left out of angel networks and investing communities. We create curated, trust-based access to investment opportunities, including startup deals, financial products, and savings vehicles—turning knowledge into action.   Missing Community Support: Financial decision-making is often isolating. Playbook offers peer-to-peer networks, collaborative investment pools, and local meetups across key cities—enabling learning and investing in a social, safe, and inspiring environment.

Global racing titles dominate the market but often overlook the rich stories, environments, and racing heritage of Saudi Arabia.  This lack of representation means that millions of passionate gamers in the Kingdom and the region do not see their identity, culture, or environment reflected in the games they love. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is rapidly positioning itself as a global hub for gaming and eSports as part of its Vision 2030 strategy — creating a clear opportunity for localized, culturally relevant content to thrive.  DaCorsa addresses this gap by offering the first Saudi AAA-level racing game, designed with Saudi tracks, landscapes, and cultural elements at its core. The game aims to bridge the gap between global gaming standards and local cultural pride, providing both regional players and international audiences with a fresh, authentic racing experience.

Our goal is simple and modest: to provide a granular measuring tool for any educational program without interfering with their academic freedom or operating ways.

Tokenization can help by focusing on results and long-term impacts, being transparent and open, and supporting ownership and leadership of those who benefit from it.

Our solution serves all stakeholders of the whole lifecycle of Learning Tokens:  granters, holders, verifiers, market actors, and governance institutions. 

Granters are Institutions, Instructors, and Courses that need trustful, transparent, and decentralized certificates of competence. Holders are Learners who need ownership of their learning process records and certificates. Verifiers are potential Employers, Partners, Investors, and Clients needing trustful certification of competence. Market actors are potential beneficiaries of skill profiles for recruiting talent. Governance Institutions are the authorities that regulate this lifecycle of educational experiences.

The solution impacts their lives through granular evidence-based measurement of competencies that they currently do not have.

Units of competency are consensually agreed statements of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values required for effective performance in a particular function. Instructors define units of competence in a course or a training program that transmits and certifies them. Lessons might convey multiple units of competency, and diverse assessments might confirm the efficacy of an educational strategy.

Four measurements assess learning: assistance to lessons, the score of responses to tests and tasks, engagement in class, and the feedback learners give for instructors' performance.

This solution will ensure that each skilled tag is justified and guaranteed to reflect the understanding level of learners. Fields of knowledge are standard CIP Codes from the Classification of Instructional Programs created by the National Center for Educational Statistics of the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education. Skills come from SFIA. AI helps instructors define the metadata for both. 

Learning Tokens can help to reach every student, assess learning levels regularly, prioritize teaching the fundamentals, increase the efficiency of instruction, and develop psychosocial health and well-being.

Learning tokens can support the four motivational variables of goal orientation, self-efficacy, grit, and need for cognition. Provide goals to increase competence and performance goals to succeed with favorable assessments from others. Improve our belief to accomplish tasks. Support perseverance and passion for long-term goals. And ground the need for cognition

","Juguetes is solving multiple problems for parents and children:  

1. Reducing Toy Clutter – Many parents struggle with accumulating toys that their children quickly outgrow or lose interest in. Juguetes provides a convenient way to swap or buy old toys for new ones, keeping homes clutter-free.  

2. Saving Money – Constantly buying new toys can be expensive. Juguetes offers a cost-effective alternative by allowing parents to buy pre-loved toys at a nominal price instead of purchasing new ones.  

3. Encouraging Sustainability – The toy industry generates a lot of plastic waste. Juguetes helps reduce waste and promote reuse, making it an eco-friendly option for families.  

4. Keeping Kids Engaged – Children love new toys, but their interests change quickly. Juguetes ensures that kids always have access to new and exciting toys without parents needing to spend excessively.  

5. Building a Community – Juguetes fosters a sharing culture where families can connect, exchange quality toys, and contribute to a sustainable cycle of play.

Inability to finance partnerships with certified recycling facilities to meet Vision 2030’s 95% e-waste diversion target.  How inspireU Helps:  Grants or seed funding to pilot my solution in high-impact neighborhoods.  Access to STC’s investor network for long-term financial sustainability.  2. Strategic Resource Gaps Current Struggle:  Lack of technical mentorship to optimize blockchain-based tracking systems.  Limited logistics partnerships for efficient e-waste pickup/delivery.  How inspireU Helps:  STC’s Expertise: Leverage their IoT/5G infrastructure for real-time monitoring and cost-efficient operations.  Mentorship: Guidance from STC’s tech and sustainability leaders to refine my business model.  3. Aligning with STC’s Vision Why STC?:  STC’s commitment to sustainability (e.g., carbon neutrality goals) directly complements my mission to convert e-waste into resources.  Their nationwide retail network can host my smart kiosks, accelerating user adoption.  Synergy Example:  Integrating my reward system with STC’s app to incentivize recycling through mobile data discounts or device upgrades.  4.

By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, PLATMA transforms plain English descriptions into fully functional workflows and applications, democratizing software development for users without programming expertise. 
TECH.EU

In the telecommunications sector, PLATMA offers tailored solutions to enhance operational efficiency and service delivery. Telecom companies can utilize PLATMA to automate processes such as customer onboarding, billing, network management, and support services. The platform's ability to interpret natural language allows telecom professionals to design and implement workflows that address specific operational challenges, leading to improved responsiveness and customer satisfaction.

By integrating PLATMA, telecommunications providers can accelerate their digital transformation initiatives, reduce reliance on extensive coding, and swiftly adapt to evolving market demands. This positions PLATMA as a valuable asset for telecom companies aiming to innovate and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.","Time-Consuming Search for Shared Rides: Pilgrims and tourists often spend excessive time searching for shared rides, which complicates travel arrangements. Rehla streamlines this process, allowing users to easily find and book rides, saving valuable time.
Negotiating Ride Prices: Pilgrims and tourists typically have to negotiate prices individually. Rehla eliminates the need for price haggling by providing transparent, fixed pricing for all services, making the process easier and more predictable.

Lack of Transparency and Trip Tracking: Information about drivers or service providers may be anonymous, and there is no system to track the trip. Rehla provides detailed driver information and real-time trip tracking, ensuring safety and transparency for all customers.
High Costs of Intercity Transportation and Guided Tours: The cost of intercity transportation and guided tours can often be high, making travel less affordable. Rehla offers cost-effective solutions, reducing travel expenses for both intercity transportation and guided tours.","PLATMA envisions a future where businesses, regardless of size or technical expertise, can seamlessly automate and optimize their operations through intuitive, AI-driven no-code solutions. Our goal is to democratize software development, enabling organizations to reduce routine tasks by up to 70% without the need for expensive, highly qualified specialists. 

We are committed to continuous innovation, with plans to enhance our platform's capabilities, including the integration of advanced AI builders and expanded workflow automation features. By doing so, we aim to empower businesses to rapidly adapt to evolving market demands and technological advancements.

In line with our vision, PLATMA has secured $2.5 million in pre-seed funding to support our expansion into the Middle East, North Africa (MENA), Central Asia, and North America regions.

We are a UK-based FinTech helping over 1.2 million Muslims around the World to manage and grow their wealth without compromising on their religious beliefs. 

We do this in two primary ways;

1.	With a UK Consumer app that helps over 80,000 active users to budget, save and invest in shariah compliant initiatives

2.	A software service that helps Banks around the World to better serve Muslim customers by introducing personalized, faith-based features into their banking apps. From budgeting and savings tools to zakat calculation and shariah screening of investments and products. We currently work with Bank Islam Malaysia, Maybank UK, Bank Muamalat, and have POCs with Emirates Islamic Bank and Allied Bank Limited.

Traction: We generate 500k USD in annual recurring revenue, have 3 B2B clients, 2 active Proof of Concepts and an inbound pipeline of 50+ more banks. We have raised a seed round of $1.5m USD and hope to raise a Series A round this year.

Kestrl has offices in London UK, Johor Malaysia and is currently opening a GCC HQ in Riyadh KSA. Kestrl also holds a UK Open Banking license and are currently acquiring an Investment Management license to better distribute wealth products through its application.","B2C Problem: 
Islamic Banks in the West are notorious for poor UX, terrible customers service and higher fees. The net result: Extremely poor take up of Islamic finance services DESPITE high demand. Kestrl solves this with a UK consumer app that's open banking enabled. Customers download the app, connect bank accounts, Kestrl will then analyse spending data to create a financial plan and recommend shariah compliant products.

Kestrl' consumer app is open banking enabled. Customers connect their bank accounts, Kestrl then analyses their spending and income data to create a financial plan for them. Building a budget, a savings plan, and crucially linking them with shariah compliant investments and savings products. All of this in a beautiful, digitally enabled UX.

B2B Problem:
Banks in emerging markets are under increasing pressure to digitise. Mid to small-tier banks feel this the most as they lack the budgets to build internally and truly compete with top tiers and new neo banks. Kestrl has white labelled its consumer app features and makes them available to these banks, enabling them to go to market rapidly with new solutions, increase their customer/deposit base, and better retain these customers.","I would like to inform you that my current job is the Saudi Center for Economic Business, a platform from which most of the emerging government representatives enter companies and document them all with investors around the world.

1. STC App Marketplace & Flagship EdTech App
    * STC’s app marketplace provides a large upper funnel for digital services, and by featuring Sandbook as its flagship EdTech app, STC can expand its family user base and reinforce its brand as a leader in digital education solutions.
    * This collaboration would drive higher user engagement within the STC ecosystem while giving Sandbook direct access to millions of STC customers, accelerating adoption across Saudi households.

- Inefficient Ordering & Inventory Management
Many F&B businesses still rely on manual, fragmented, and outdated ordering systems.
This leads to misplaced orders, stockouts, over-purchasing, and wasted inventory.
SupTomer provides a centralized dashboard for real-time tracking, automated ordering, and seamless inventory control.

- Lack of Supplier-Merchant Transparency
Poor communication between suppliers and merchants causes delays, incorrect orders, and procurement inefficiencies.
SupTomer enables direct, streamlined communication between buyers and suppliers, ensuring accurate order fulfillment.

- High Procurement Costs & Waste
Businesses struggle with high procurement costs and excessive food waste due to inefficient supply chain management.
SupTomer reduces costs by automating purchasing, optimizing supplier selection, and using data-driven insights to prevent unnecessary spending.


- Limited Access to Competitive Suppliers
Restaurants and food businesses struggle to discover better suppliers, promotions, and cost-effective sourcing options.
SupTomer’s marketplace connects merchants with a wide range of suppliers, offering competitive pricing and better supplier choices.

By solving these challenges, SupTomer enhances operational efficiency, minimizes waste, reduces procurement costs, and improves supply chain transparency, empowering F&B businesses to run more smoothly and profitably.","- Real-time payments: 96% of manufacturers expect real-time payments to replace traditional checks for outgoing payments by 2026.

- Virtual cards: These offer enhanced security and revenue-generating opportunities for expense management.

- Flexible payment options: integrating Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)  and invoice financing services, which are becoming popular in B2B transactions, especially in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region.

Our goal is simple and modest: to provide a granular measuring tool for any educational program without interfering with their academic freedom or operating ways.

Tokenization can help by focusing on results and long-term impacts, being transparent and open, and supporting ownership and leadership of those who benefit from it.

Our solution serves all stakeholders of the whole lifecycle of Learning Tokens:  granters, holders, verifiers, market actors, and governance institutions. 

Granters are Institutions, Instructors, and Courses that need trustful, transparent, and decentralized certificates of competence. Holders are Learners who need ownership of their learning process records and certificates. Verifiers are potential Employers, Partners, Investors, and Clients needing trustful certification of competence. Market actors are potential beneficiaries of skill profiles for recruiting talent. Governance Institutions are the authorities that regulate this lifecycle of educational experiences.

The solution impacts their lives through granular evidence-based measurement of competencies that they currently do not have.

Units of competency are consensually agreed statements of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values required for effective performance in a particular function. Instructors define units of competence in a course or a training program that transmits and certifies them. Lessons might convey multiple units of competency, and diverse assessments might confirm the efficacy of an educational strategy.

Four measurements assess learning: assistance to lessons, the score of responses to tests and tasks, engagement in class, and the feedback learners give for instructors' performance.

This solution will ensure that each skilled tag is justified and guaranteed to reflect the understanding level of learners. Fields of knowledge are standard CIP Codes from the Classification of Instructional Programs created by the National Center for Educational Statistics of the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education. Skills come from SFIA. AI helps instructors define the metadata for both. 

Learning Tokens can help to reach every student, assess learning levels regularly, prioritize teaching the fundamentals, increase the efficiency of instruction, and develop psychosocial health and well-being.

Learning tokens can support the four motivational variables of goal orientation, self-efficacy, grit, and need for cognition. Provide goals to increase competence and performance goals to succeed with favorable assessments from others. Improve our belief to accomplish tasks. Support perseverance and passion for long-term goals. And ground the need for cognition

As STC expands its footprint into satellite connectivity and advanced digital services, StratoAI can provide the intelligent operations layer that ensures these space assets run smoothly, reliably, and with minimal human oversight.

StratoAI’s core strength lies in making satellite operations smarter and more autonomous. By working together, STC could reduce its operational costs, speed up satellite deployment, and offer its customers faster and more resilient services. Instead of building expensive mission control systems from scratch, STC could rely on StratoAI’s platform to manage satellite health, respond quickly to unexpected events, and keep missions running efficiently. This would allow STC to focus more on delivering value through its network, rather than managing the complexities of satellite operations.

For StratoAI, this partnership would offer the chance to work with one of the Middle East’s most forward-looking telecom providers and expand its presence in a region that’s actively investing in space technology. Co-developing solutions tailored to STC’s needs would not only help improve StratoAI’s platform but also establish a strong foundation for broader collaborations across the Gulf region.

Together, StratoAI and STC could play a central role in making space-based connectivity more accessible, reliable, and intelligent, supporting the broader goals of digital transformation and innovation in Saudi Arabia.

This evidence-based measurement can increase learners' motivation and improve the efficiency of instruction.

Skills are taught and learned through the transmission of knowledge. We tokenize this real-world asset as a unique representation of value recorded in a blockchain.

Learning Tokens recognize, at a granular level,  units of competency and five sequential actions to transmit them. An instructor conveys a unit of competency. A learner acquires it. The instructor assesses such acquisition. The learner responds correctly to this evaluation. The instructor awards the learner formal recognition of competence. A token registers the value of acquiring knowledge.

This granularity allows for measuring formative assessments in detail, describing the logic of their aggregations throughout curricula, interweaving individual learning paths, and assembling skill profiles for life.","Lunchy’s vision is to become the leading companion for families across the MENA region when it comes to child nutrition.

Only 30% regularly read Arabic books, and many lack motivation to learn the language in a meaningful way. From user research, four pain points stood out: •	Engagement is low. 60% of parents and educators say Arabic apps are boring. •	Speaking is neglected. 30% say it’s the most important skill, yet most tools skip it. •	Progress is unclear. Parents and teachers can’t track how kids are improving. •	There’s no shared learning. Kids learn alone, which kills motivation.","FiTech is an AI personal-Trainer.

In Saudi Arabia alone, cooling consumes over 171 terawatt-hours annually, accounting for 50–70% of total electricity consumption and contributing up to 50% of national CO₂ emissions. Traditional HVAC systems, operating at low efficiency (COP ~2.5), become even less effective in extreme temperatures, significantly driving up costs and placing heavy burdens on national grids due to subsidized electricity prices.   Relevant to STC, we are targeting Data Centers. Data centers are especially impacted, as cooling comprises over 60% of their total non-IT energy consumption. For instance, a typical 240 MW-e data center requires around 144 MW-th of cooling capacity.

Today, space companies spend millions building internal mission control systems that don’t scale with constellation growth. Operators face constant bottlenecks in telemetry analysis, anomaly detection, task scheduling, and satellite maneuver approvals, all requiring human oversight around the clock.

This operational burden leads to:

1. 15–20% revenue loss due to inefficient ops models

2. Linear scaling of ops teams with satellite count

3. Delays in response to anomalies and opportunities

4. Wasted engineering resources on maintaining fragmented systems rather than mission goals

For that case, FalconAI allows any player with a smartphone to upload videos and get analyzed, removing geographic and financial barriers.  3.Fragmented Player Development: in Saudi, young football players often lack continuous feedback and structured, personalized development plans, which limits their growth. For that reason, the Smart Coach in FalconAI suggests personalized training plans based on measurable weaknesses and strengths, and updates them as players progress.  4.Inefficiency in Club Recruitment: clubs and academies spend excessive time and resources attending physical trials and sifting through inconsistent scouting reports. When using FalconAI, clubs access structured player profiles, biometric data, and standardized performance metrics—making scouting efficient and scalable.  5.Lack of Longitudinal Tracking: most clubs and academies in Saudi Arabi have often no centralized record of a player’s performance or physical development over time, so FalconAI aims to build evolving player profiles that track development across months and years.","Our vision is to become the leading rental ecosystem in the MENA.

It automates medical and dental file completion for doctors and generates educational reports for patients.,"The Core Problems FalconAI Solves 1: Subjectivity in Talent Evaluation: traditional scouting heavily relies on human judgment, which is often biased, inconsistent, and influenced by limited exposure to a player's full potential, while the evaluation in FalconAI ensures objective, data-backed assessments of physical and technical performance.  2: Limited Access to Scouting Opportunities: many talented players especially in cities where players lack exposure to professional scouts or structured development programs. For that case, FalconAI allows any player with a smartphone to upload videos and get analyzed, removing geographic and financial barriers.  3.Fragmented Player Development: in Saudi, young football players often lack continuous feedback and structured, personalized development plans, which limits their growth. For that reason, the Smart Coach in FalconAI suggests personalized training plans based on measurable weaknesses and strengths, and updates them as players progress.  4.Inefficiency in Club Recruitment: clubs and academies spend excessive time and resources attending physical trials and sifting through inconsistent scouting reports. When using FalconAI, clubs access structured player profiles, biometric data, and standardized performance metrics—making scouting efficient and scalable.  5.Lack of Longitudinal Tracking: most clubs and academies in Saudi Arabi have often no centralized record of a player’s performance or physical development over time, so FalconAI aims to build evolving player profiles that track development across months and years.",supporting government and universities digital learning initiatives.

The app creates a digital ecosystem where parents can stay connected with their children, monitor their activities, and manage family schedules—directly integrated with the telecom network. This enhances brand loyalty by providing meaningful, family-oriented services.
	3.	Understanding the Child & Family Market:
Through regular engagement, the app will gather behavioral insights on children’s interests, hobbies, and digital consumption, as well as parental expectations. This empowers the any telecom company to tailor products and services that reflect the evolving needs of families.
	4.	Social Responsibility & Brand Image:
Launching an app dedicated to children and families reinforces the company’s social responsibility profile, positioning it as a brand that cares about family wellbeing, digital parenting, and child safety.

The app will serve as a channel to introduce educational and eco-friendly technologies to children, supporting the company’s sustainability initiatives and promoting responsible digital habits from a young age.

Inability to finance partnerships with certified recycling facilities to meet Vision 2030’s 95% e-waste diversion target.  How inspireU Helps:  Grants or seed funding to pilot my solution in high-impact neighborhoods.  Access to STC’s investor network for long-term financial sustainability.  2. Strategic Resource Gaps Current Struggle:  Lack of technical mentorship to optimize blockchain-based tracking systems.  Limited logistics partnerships for efficient e-waste pickup/delivery.

Mentorship: Guidance from STC’s tech and sustainability leaders to refine my business model.  3.

Our proprietary AI-driven engine enhances financial institutions by offering predictive savings models, data analytics, and customer engagement tools. Through a seamless, white-label B2B solution, Paimind empowers banking services to provide intelligent financial planning, ensuring customer retention and new revenue streams.","Despite the significant growth of the gaming industry in Saudi Arabia and the broader MENA region, there remains a noticeable gap in locally produced, high-quality racing games that authentically represent the region's culture, landscapes, and aspirations. Global racing titles dominate the market but often overlook the rich stories, environments, and racing heritage of Saudi Arabia.  This lack of representation means that millions of passionate gamers in the Kingdom and the region do not see their identity, culture, or environment reflected in the games they love. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is rapidly positioning itself as a global hub for gaming and eSports as part of its Vision 2030 strategy — creating a clear opportunity for localized, culturally relevant content to thrive.  DaCorsa addresses this gap by offering the first Saudi AAA-level racing game, designed with Saudi tracks, landscapes, and cultural elements at its core. The game aims to bridge the gap between global gaming standards and local cultural pride, providing both regional players and international audiences with a fresh, authentic racing experience.  This is not just about entertainment — it's about enabling Saudi creative talent, telling local stories, and contributing to the Kingdom's ambition to lead in the global gaming ecosystem.","Our vision is to become the leading platform for buying and selling SMEs in Saudi Arabia, and to grow into an all-in-one business hub that offers a complete value chain for entrepreneurship, ownership, and investment.

Alchemyst builds functional units that can be customised to the utmost possible degree. Each unit is logically independent, and is clearly delineated from the other units through interfaces and facades. This lets users take full advantage of almost all capabilities from any vertical.

Thinking of it like Lego blocks - we can mix-and-match almost any component with another one, just need to retrofit them with the respective interface requirements of the components you want to use.

The virtual personas will be built from these lego bricks, to allow us to prototype fast and improve even faster.

And, what's the best part? Alchemysts have built their own AI Infrastructure to safeguard Data Privacy of their clients, as well as being compliant with all the leading global regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO.

Global racing titles dominate the market but often overlook the rich stories, environments, and racing heritage of Saudi Arabia.  This lack of representation means that millions of passionate gamers in the Kingdom and the region do not see their identity, culture, or environment reflected in the games they love. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is rapidly positioning itself as a global hub for gaming and eSports as part of its Vision 2030 strategy — creating a clear opportunity for localized, culturally relevant content to thrive.

The game aims to bridge the gap between global gaming standards and local cultural pride, providing both regional players and international audiences with a fresh, authentic racing experience.
